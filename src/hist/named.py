            Provide one value or array per dimension.

        **kwargs : Used similar to args but however gives the flexibilty to

            fill values into axes using their names instead of their index.

        weight : List[Union[Array[float], Array[int], Array[str], float, int, str]]]

            Provide weights (only if the histogram storage supports it)

        NOTE: the weight keyword is not explicitly mentioned in the call to the

            function but however is instead stored inside kwargs from where it is passed on.

        Used to plot the count and the pull plot of a particular axis given. For more details regarding the
        extension of the function to more genral cases please refer to the readme file in the repository.


        Paramters

        ---------

        callable : the equation of the PDF to be plotted, in the example given a Gaussian distribution was

            used

        ax : The axis used to make the figure of the pdf and the scatter plot of the points

        pull_ax : The axis used to make the figure of the pull plot

        style : The style of the plot, by default it is the Seaborn-Deep but however can be reverted to more

            informative plots by passing the required argument

        figsize : a tuple that is used to determine the size of the figure

        save_fig : the title for the figure if it is to be saved. Note that it will be saved as a png

            hence adding an extension in not required

        Process

        -------

        The function takes the above arguments and then plots the two figures, that is, the pdf along with
        the points as well as a pull plot of the same. Note that this fucntion is only capable of producing
        plots for one dimensional plots and not for the multi dimensional case. For more information on how
        this function could be extended can be found in the readme.

        Output

        ------

        ax : The axis that was either passed into the function or the one produced for the pdf

        pull_ax : The axis that was either passed into the function or the one that was produced

            for the pull plot.
